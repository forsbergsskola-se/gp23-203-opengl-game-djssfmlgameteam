Description:
This game is a botched attempt at making a RPG game.
After the getting stuck on a million issues a million times in a week I realized that I would not be able to create a RPG game.
I was also very put off by SFML being so slow and requiring way to much coding for things to happen.
In Unity I can set up the same scene I did in SFML but instead of in 2 weeks it would take me 5 minutes.
This bored and frustrated me.
Especially after sinking 8 hours trying to get the game work with a sprite sheet for movement.
I never got it to work and discarded all the code.
I did not feel like I learned anything while doign SFML.
So i divided up my time working on this "Game" and studying a great C++ course on udemy named: 
Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond
After the two weeks I have completed 153 / 305 lessons.
I felt like doing the course was very fun and I filled in a lot of my c++ holes that I felt I had.

Back to the "Game".
Evetually I just threw together so that the character could stand in a blue box and then it prints to the console.
Overall the experience with SFML can be summarized in one word "Tedious".
